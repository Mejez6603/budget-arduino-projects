# Budget Arduino Projects

**A compilation of budget Arduino projects using a starter kit purchased online.** This repository contains several small Arduino projects designed to maximize learning while minimizing cost, making it ideal for hobbyists and beginners.

---

## Features

* Multiple Arduino projects in one repository
* Low-cost, easily reproducible designs
* Step-by-step instructions for setup and usage
* Variety of projects: sensors, displays, buzzers, LEDs, and more
* Educational for beginners in electronics and programming

---

## Technologies Used

* **Arduino UNO R3** (or compatible boards)
* Breadboard and jumper wires
* Various sensors (ultrasonic, sound sensor, tilt switch, etc.)
* LEDs and resistors
* Buzzers
* OLED / LCD displays
* Servo and stepper motors
* Pushbuttons and potentiometers

---

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/budget-arduino-projects.git
   ```
2. **Open Arduino IDE**
3. **Select the correct board and COM port**
4. **Open the project folder and upload the code**
5. **Connect the hardware according to the circuit diagrams**

---

## Usage

Each project has its own folder with:

* Circuit diagram
* Arduino sketch file (.ino)
* Component list and wiring instructions
* README for that specific project

Follow the instructions in each project folder to build and run the project.
